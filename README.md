Objective of the Project:
To analyze and visualize COVID-19 data to observe trends in total cases and deaths across different countries.
Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: Programming language for data processing and visualization.
Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
IPyWidgets: For interactive plotting.
Data Source(s):
The project uses a dataset named "https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv" sourced from Our World in Data.
Execution Steps:
Load the Dataset:
Place the dataset (owid-covid-data.csv) in the appropriate directory (e.g., /content/).
Run the Notebook:
Open the notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.
Execute each cell sequentially to clean the data and generate visualizations.
Visualize Trends:
Use the interactive widget to select countries and view COVID-19 trends.
Save plots for specific countries using the provided function.
Summary of Results:
Cleaned and structured COVID-19 data for analysis.
Visualized total cases and deaths trends for individual countries.
Interactive tool for selecting countries to visualize their data dynamically.
Challenges Faced:
Handling missing data in the dataset.
Formatting date columns for consistent analysis.
Customizing plots for clearer and more informative visualizations.
